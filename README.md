##Angular Crud for Two Resource API

Code Fellows JS401 Assignment 5/16/16

Create a C(reate) R(ead) U(pdate) D(estroy) interface for your two resource JSON api using Angular. When doing a data transaction, don't refetch the entire list, just insert the returned new object or remove the object from the list. Also, make sure that when you cancel your edit it shows the original value (don't just use a getAll()).
